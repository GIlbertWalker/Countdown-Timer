# Countdown-Timer
Our first challenge, a countdown timer coding project.   This is a  vanilla JavaScript challenge that focuses on testing your ability to work with the DOM model.


Implement the countdown timer as described in the video.

This is a vanilla JS project i.e. you only need to code in JS to solve this problem.

The HTML & CSS components should not be changed.

Download the assets.zip file for the starter files for this project from the downloads section of the page.
